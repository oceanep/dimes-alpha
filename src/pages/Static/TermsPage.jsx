Dimes “Users” are the people who have created a Dimes account, and Dimes “Invitees” are people who have scheduled a meeting with a Dimes User but may or may not have registered with Dimes. A Dimes “Viewer” is a person who visits the Dimes Website but may or may not be a Dimes User or Dimes Invitee.</p>

                <p>Dimes’s Website facilitates online scheduling of appointments. You may access and use the Website in accordance with these Terms. Please note that these Terms govern your use of the Website, including, but not limited to, the process through which your Invitees schedule appointments with you.</p>

                <p>When using the features of the Website you are subject to any agreements, policies or guidelines applicable to such features that may be posted from time to time. All such agreements, policies or guidelines, including the Privacy Policy, are hereby incorporated by reference into these Terms.</p>

                <h3>GENERAL USE</h3>

                <p>We invite you to use this Website for your individual purposes and not for the purposes of reselling (&quot;Permitted Purposes&quot;).</p>

                <p>Subject to these Terms, we grant you a limited, personal, non-exclusive and non-transferable license to use and to display the Materials and a limited, personal, non-exclusive and non-transferable right to access and use the Website following the set-up of an account as set forth below. You have no other rights in the Website and you may not modify, edit, copy, reproduce, create derivative works of, reverse engineer, alter, enhance, or in any way exploit any portion of the Website in any manner.

                <p>When you create an account, we collect registration-related information, which includes your email address and your name.
